### Purpose
The purpose of this is to teach anyone how to build their own gaming computer. The process can seem overwhelming and impossible but, if you take your time and do your research, you can build your own gaming PC!

### Prerequisite
The will to learn something new!

### Basic Parts

This section will briefly descibe the main components needed in a computer build.

* GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)- Commonly refered to as Graphics cards, it is a specialized processor designed for rendering all images on the computer screen.

* CPU (Central Processing Unit)- is the part of a computer that retreives and executes instructions. It is basically the brain of the computer. 

* Motherboard- the motherboard is a printed circuit board that is the backbone of your build. It connects different componets together, allocates power, and more.

* RAM (Random Access Memory)- this is where the computer stores data before it is processed. It is used for taks that require fast access to computing resources.

* SSD/HDD (Storage)- storage for you PC essesntially comes down to two options: Solid State Drives (SSDs) and hard disk drives (HDDs). This is where all of your files and media are stored.

* Power Supply- is exactly what it sounds like: it gets electricity from the outlet to the parts of your system. It can be tricky to pick out but once you do, you wil not think about it again once installed.

* Case- is mostly a decorative choice. Some cases inlude fans which is important for cooling the system. 

### Designing Your Build

Building your own PC is a creative process. How much do I want to spend? Do I want to choose a GPU then build around it? Do I choose a case I like then try to make the parts fit in those parameters?

When I build a computer I like to start with "why" I want to build one first. I like to build a PC that can run the latest games smoothly and has room for upgrades. It needs to be at least as powerful as the newest Xbox or Playstation so I can compare and compete across game platforms.

This is probably the most important and time consuming step in your build. You want to make sure that you can afford the build you design and make sure your parts will work together. To make this step easier I've added a few links to websites that can give you a rough estimate of cost and compatability  for your computer build.

### Shopping for Parts

There are many websites and stores you can visit to shop for parts. It would be wise to use one of the websites listed above to make sure all your parts are compatible then search for the best price for the parts picked.

Ideally, you want to buy your parts from reputable brands - Corsair, Western Digital, G. Skill, NVIDIA, and so forth. Money can be saved by going for no-name manufacturers but reliability, quality, and customer service will likely suffer.
