### Purpose
The purpose of this is to teach anyone how to build their own gaming computer. 


### Prerequisite




### Basic Parts

* GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)- Commonly refered to as Graphics cards, it is a specialized processor designed for rendering all images on the computer screen.

* CPU (Central Processing Unit)- is the part of a computer that retreives and executes instructions. It is basically the brain of the computer. 

* Motherboard- the motherboard is a printed circuit board that is the backbone of your build. It connects different componets together, allocates power, and more.

* RAM (Random Access Memory)- this is where the computer stores data before it is processed. It is used for taks that require fast access to computing resources.

* SSD/HDD (Storage)- storage for you PC essesntially comes down to two options: Solid State Drives (SSDs) and hard disk drives (HDDs). This is where all of your files and media are stored.

* Power Supply- is exactly what it sounds like: it gets electricity from the outlet to the parts of your system. It can be tricky to pick out but once you do, you wil not think about it again once installed.

* Case- is mostly a decorative choice. Some cases inlude fans which is important for cooling the system. 

### Designing Your Build

Building your own PC is a creative process. How much do I want to spend? Do I want to choose a GPU then build around it? Do I choose a case I like then try to make the parts fit in those parameters?

When I build a computer I like to start with "why" I want to build one first. I like to build a PC that can run the latest games smoothly and has room for upgrades. It needs to be at least as powerful as the newest Xbox or Playstation so I can compare and compete across game platforms.

This is probably the most important and time consuming step in your build. You want to make sure that you can afford the build you design and make sure your parts will work together. To make this step easier I've added a few links to websites that can give you a rough estimate of cost and bottleneck/choke points for your computer.
